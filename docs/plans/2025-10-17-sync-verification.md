# Plan â€” Repository Sync Verification (2025-10-17)

## Goal
Confirm that the local `work` branch reflects all intended updates and no pending changes remain uncommitted.

## Approach
1. Inspect git status to verify a clean working tree and index.
2. Review recent commits on the `work` branch for any unexpected differences.
3. Summarize findings and update the live plan to reflect completion.

## Files To Change / Create
- `docs/plans/2025-10-17-sync-verification.md` (this plan document)
- `PLAN.md` (update live plan steps/status)

## Tests
- No automated tests required; this task only verifies repository state.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Misinterpreting repository state if additional remotes exist.
  - **Mitigation:** Explicitly note absence of remotes or unusual configuration.
