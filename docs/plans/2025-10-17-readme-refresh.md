# Plan: README Expansion & Documentation Alignment

## Metadata
- **Status:** complete
- **Owner:** Codex Autonomous Engineering Brain
- **Last Updated:** 2025-10-17

## Objectives
- Replace the placeholder README with comprehensive documentation covering goals, architecture, data integrations, local setup, testing, and deployment.
- Capture endpoint query recipes, data freshness expectations, and observability/alerting policies referenced by the specification.
- Link to relevant plans, ADRs, and onboarding materials per repository conventions.

## Assumptions
- No additional documentation exists beyond the current README and AGENTS guide.
- Endpoint, data, and observability specifications are available within repository context or must be inferred from provided instructions.
- No existing ADRs or onboarding checklists are present; create references only if such artifacts exist.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Missing canonical specification details could lead to inaccurate documentation.
  - *Mitigation:* Clearly state assumptions and indicate placeholders where verification is required.
- **Risk:** README may become outdated if additional docs are added later.
  - *Mitigation:* Highlight link sections for future updates and align with conventions in AGENTS.md.

## Deliverables
1. Updated `README.md` with required sections and references.
2. Documentation of endpoint query recipes, freshness expectations, and observability policies.
3. Links within README to plan, ADRs, and onboarding checklists (only if present).

## Approach
1. Analyze existing repository structure for specs, ADRs, and onboarding materials.
2. Draft comprehensive README sections aligning with requested content and AGENTS.md conventions.
3. Review and refine README for clarity, consistency, and linkage requirements.

## Files to Change/Create
- `README.md`
- `docs/plans/2025-10-17-readme-refresh.md` (this plan)

## Test Plan
- Documentation change only; validate via markdown linting (visual inspection) if tooling available.

## Rollback Strategy
- Revert README to previous placeholder or the last known good commit.

## Timeline
1. **Plan** — complete
2. **Implementation** — complete
3. **Review** — complete
